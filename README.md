## Why spend time for reproducibility?
The point isnt as much to make your code error free and very efficient but to document it well so:
- it inspire more trust
- some one can use/debug/reproduce your work
- it may not be correct but it is accessible

## 4 facets of reproduciblity
- Documentation >> for accessiblity - easy to start and use
