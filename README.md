Course info is here:

Course will give steps/habits that are good return on investment in reproducibility.

## Why spend time for reproducibility?
The point isnt as much to make your code error free and very efficient but to document it well so:
- it inspire more trust
- some one can use/debug/reproduce your work
- it may not be correct but it is accessible

## 4 facets of reproduciblity
- Documentation >> for accessiblity - easy to start and use
- Organization >> for making work transparent and gaining trust
- Automation >> make analysis steps documented
- Dissemination

Distinguish folder types, name them accordingly:

**Read-only**: data, metadata
**Human-generated**: code, paper, documentation
**Project-generated**: clean data, figures, models...
